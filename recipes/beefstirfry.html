      This dish is packed with veggies, beef, and saucy flavors for a weeknight
      dinner warrior that checks all the boxes. Served with rice or lo mein
      noodles, this will be the best beef stir-fry you've ever made.

    <h2>How to Make Beef Stir-Fry</h2>
    <p>
      The most time-consuming part of making stir-fry is all the chopping.
      Slicing your meat and veggies into smaller bite-sized pieces can take a
      little bit of time and effort, but it's worth it for the end result.
    </p>
    <p>
      After you've chopped all your ingredients, you'll cook the beef on one
      side of the wok, or another large frying pan, and the veggies on the other
      side of the wok. Once they're all cooked, you can mix the two sides
      together and add the soy sauce and sesame seeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some stir-fry recipes use a specific stir-fry sauce, which can be as basic
      as broth, soy sauce, sugar, and rice wine vinegar. This quick stir-fry
      calls for only soy sauce. But you can feel free to add a stir-fry sauce or
      marinate your beef in one if you prefer.
    </p>
    <h2>What Cut of Beef Is Best For Beef Stir-Fry?</h2>
    <p>
      Flank steaks are the most popular choice for making a stir-fry. However,
      you can also use sirloin steak, skirt steak, Denver steak, or even beef
      chuck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beef chuck steak is the most economical choice, but it does require some
      extra trimming. You'll want to remove the tough tissue from the steaks
      before frying.
    </p>
    <h2>How to Cook Beef Stir-Fry</h2>
    <p>
      If possible, you should use a wok to make beef stir-fry. Woks are large
      and have sloping sides that let you cook the entire stir-fry in one pan,
      so you can easily stir and flip the food without fear of it flying out.
      They also are designed to cook foods quicker than skillets and with less
      oil.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you can't use a wok (or another carbon steel pan) then any skillet will
      work. You may just need to cook the meat and veggies in separate batches.
      When cooking, make sure you heat the pan and oil up first before adding
      your ingredients — they should sizzle as soon as they hit the heat. And
      always use an oil with a high smoke point, like canola or peanut oil, for
      the best stir-fry results.
